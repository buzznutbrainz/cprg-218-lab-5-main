            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <p>The Reverse card has the following effects in the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Changing direction:</strong> When played, the direction of play switches between clockwise and counterclockwise. This can strategically alter the turn order to benefit or challenge players.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-player game:</strong> In a two-player game, playing a Reverse card acts like a Skip card, causing the other player to lose their turn and allowing the player who played the Reverse card to play again.</li>
                <li><strong>Stacking rules:</strong> In some variations of Uno, if you have another Reverse card in hand, you can play it immediately, even if it's not your turn, effectively "stacking" the card to change the direction again.</li>
            </ul>
