            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <p>The Draw 2 and Draw 4 cards have the following effects in the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Draw 2:</strong> The next player must draw two cards and lose their turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Draw 4:</strong> The next player must draw four cards and lose their turn. Additionally, the player who plays this card can choose the next color to be matched.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> In some variations, if the next player thinks the Draw 4 was played illegally (the player had a matching card), they can challenge it. If the challenge is successful, the original player draws four instead; otherwise, the challenger draws six.</li>
